    {
      "question": "Why does asbestos survey standardization matter?",
      "answer": "Incomplete or inconsistent surveys create regulatory risk. AbateIQ helps keep each inspection standardized, traceable, and defensible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can teams manage chain-of-custody records in AbateIQ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Sample workflows include custody details that remain connected to inspection and reporting records."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes an asbestos survey defensible?",
      "answer": "Clear material descriptions, precise locations, complete sample metadata, and traceable lab/chain-of-custody records. AbateIQ standardizes these elements so reports stay consistent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does AbateIQ help with floor plan labeling?",
      "answer": "Yes. AbateIQ supports multi-floor workflows and consistent labeling so ACM locations and samples are easy to follow from field collection to final report."
