      "question": "Can AbateIQ speed up NEA reporting?",
      "answer": "Yes. Structured workflows reduce manual assembly and improve report consistency."

    {
      "question": "How does AbateIQ improve NEA defensibility?",
      "answer": "It links report outputs to underlying exposure and field evidence for audit-ready documentation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are NEAs rejected or challenged?",
      "answer": "NEAs are challenged when sampling data is incomplete, tasks and controls are unclear, or results aren\u2019t traceable to lab reports. AbateIQ ties NEAs directly to verified source data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does AbateIQ include validity conditions in NEAs?",
      "answer": "Yes. NEAs can include conditions required for validity (same materials, controls, work practices) and guidance on when re-evaluation is needed."
