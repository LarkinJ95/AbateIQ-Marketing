        "Air monitoring is used to determine what airborne contaminants are present and whether worker exposures exceed regulatory limits. It helps employers understand risks and implement appropriate controls to protect worker health.",
        "In environments such as construction, demolition, welding, and industrial manufacturing, airborne hazards can vary widely throughout the day. Monitoring provides the data needed to make defensible safety decisions."

        "<em>Breathing zone sampling represents the air a worker actually inhales.</em>",
        "Personal air monitoring measures contaminants directly in a worker’s breathing zone, typically within 6 to 9 inches of the nose and mouth. This area represents the air the worker actually inhales.",
        "Sampling devices are worn on the worker’s collar or shoulder, allowing the data to reflect real exposure during normal job tasks and movement.",
        "Because it accounts for task variability and worker movement, personal monitoring provides the most accurate representation of individual exposure."

      "heading": "When Personal Monitoring Is Required",
      "body": [
        "OSHA standards often require personal breathing zone samples to determine employee exposure levels and calculate time-weighted averages (TWAs).",
        "For example, exposure assessments must be based on breathing zone samples that represent the employee’s actual exposure over a work shift.",
        "Personal monitoring is essential when determining compliance with PELs, evaluating respiratory protection needs, and supporting Negative Exposure Assessments."

        "Area monitoring measures contaminant levels in a specific location rather than an individual’s breathing zone. It is used to evaluate environmental conditions and the effectiveness of engineering controls.",
        "Area samples may be placed near emission sources, inside containments, or at site boundaries to assess migration or control effectiveness."

      "heading": "When Area Monitoring Is Appropriate",
      "body": [
        "Area monitoring is useful for evaluating engineering controls such as negative air machines or ventilation systems.",
        "It helps identify contaminant sources, confirm containment effectiveness, and assess environmental conditions for nearby workers or the public.",
        "However, area monitoring alone cannot determine individual exposure for OSHA compliance."

      "heading": "Using Both Methods Together",
      "body": [
        "Combining personal and area monitoring allows organizations to correlate environmental conditions with individual exposures.",
        "For example, area monitors may identify high-concentration zones, helping industrial hygienists decide where personal monitoring is necessary.",

      "question": "Is personal air monitoring required by OSHA?",
      "answer": "Many OSHA standards require personal breathing zone samples to determine employee exposure levels and compliance with permissible exposure limits."

    {
      "question": "Can area monitoring replace personal monitoring?",
      "answer": "No. Area monitoring evaluates environmental conditions but does not represent individual exposure for compliance determinations."

      "question": "Why use both personal and area monitoring?",
      "answer": "Using both methods provides a complete picture of workplace conditions, helping identify sources, verify controls, and assess individual exposure."
