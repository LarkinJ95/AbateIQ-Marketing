      "heading": "What Is a Negative Exposure Assessment (NEA)?",
      "body": [
        "A Negative Exposure Assessment (NEA) is a documented determination that employee exposures to a hazardous substance are below the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) under specific work conditions.",
        "NEAs are commonly used in asbestos, lead, silica, and other industrial hygiene programs to demonstrate that controls are effective and that certain regulatory requirements may be reduced."

      "heading": "Why NEAs Matter",
      "body": [
        "An NEA helps employers demonstrate compliance with OSHA standards, support safe work practices, and provide defensible documentation during inspections.",
        "Under OSHA 29 CFR 1926.1101, employers may use an NEA to show asbestos exposures are below the PEL when proper controls are in place."
      ]

    {
      "heading": "When Is an NEA Required?",
      "body": [
        "You may need an NEA when performing asbestos abatement, conducting lead paint removal, cutting silica-containing materials, introducing new processes, or responding to worker exposure concerns.",
        "If work conditions change, the NEA must be reevaluated to ensure exposures remain below regulatory limits."
      ]

      "heading": "What an NEA Includes",
      "body": [
        "A complete NEA documents project and site information, descriptions of operations, engineering controls, air monitoring methods, sampling results, TWA calculations, and a final determination.",
        "This documentation supports compliance and provides a defensible record of exposure evaluation."
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "Common Misconceptions",
      "body": [
        "An NEA does not eliminate safety requirements. Controls must remain in place, work practices must remain consistent, and reassessment is required if conditions change.",
        "The NEA is valid only under the conditions observed during monitoring."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Does an NEA eliminate the need for PPE?",
      "answer": "No. PPE requirements depend on regulations and site conditions. An NEA may support adjustments but does not automatically remove PPE requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long is an NEA valid?",
      "answer": "An NEA remains valid only while work conditions, materials, and controls remain unchanged. Any changes require reevaluation."
