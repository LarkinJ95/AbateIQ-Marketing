      "heading": "What is an NEA",
      "body": [
        "A Negative Exposure Assessment (NEA) documents that employee exposures to a hazardous substance are below applicable regulatory limits under specific work conditions.",
        "NEAs are commonly used in asbestos, lead, and silica programs to support compliance decisions and demonstrate the effectiveness of controls.",
        "Reliable source data, including air monitoring results and task documentation, is critical for producing a defensible NEA."

    {
      "heading": "OSHA Requirements",
      "body": [
        "OSHA standards such as 29 CFR 1926.1101 for asbestos require employers to assess exposures and maintain documentation supporting their determinations.",
        "Traceability is essential—NEAs should link directly to air monitoring data, sampling methods, and descriptions of work practices.",
        "Final NEA reports should undergo review and quality control to ensure accuracy and defensibility."
      ]

    {
      "heading": "Required Data",
      "body": [
        "Key NEA data includes project details, description of operations, controls used, sampling methods, employee tasks, monitoring results, and exposure limit comparisons.",
        "Missing context—such as work practices or environmental conditions—can undermine the validity of conclusions.",
        "Standardized data capture workflows reduce omissions and improve consistency."

      "heading": "Common Mistakes",
      "body": [
        "Common mistakes include incomplete sampling documentation, inconsistent formatting, and failure to describe controls or work practices.",
        "Referencing outdated monitoring data or unrelated tasks can invalidate conclusions.",
        "Establishing standardized templates and review procedures helps prevent these issues."
